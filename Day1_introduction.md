>Hacking<br> 
#whats hacking?<br>

-Hacking is referred as exploiting system/server **vulnerablities**<br>

} **Hackers can be classified into two based on their ethics and based on their skill.**

% Based on their ethics classified into three black hat , white hat and grey hat 
+ Black hat:-  are criminals they have bad ethics and  they use hacking or their knowledge for bad uses/things .<br>

+ White hat hackers:- They are known as **ethical hackers**.They use hacking skill for security vulnerablity for hardware and software ,network, website ...
+ Grey hat hackers:- They are a mixture of both black hat and white hat hackers they do both activities.

{} Based on their their skill classified into four they are newbie , script kiddie , hacker and elite(prohacker)

+ Newbie:-  its known as noob hacker. A person who has recently started a any particular activity 
+ script kiddie:-Script kiddie is a derogative term that computer hackers coined to refer to immature, but often just as dangerous, exploiters of internet security weaknesses.
+ Hacker :- This types of hackers known as hackers skilled with less experience.
+ elite:- Known as pro hackers. Elite hacker is a social designation indebted to hackers who are most skilled in hacking.They are skilled with experience.
>#why we learn hacking ?

There are a lot of reason but some of them are 
1. To safeguard data 
2. To avoid security breaches
3. To enhance security awereness

>#why hacking happens?

  
   Attack motive(goal)---> method ---> vulnerablity
>#whaat are elements of information security?
 
 + its known as **CIA**<br>
 C - stand for **confidentality<br>**
 I - stand for **integrity<br>**
 A - stand for **availablity**

 >#skills we need to be a hacker

 + Linux opreating system 
 + programming skill(python, bash , java...)<br>
 + Networking 
 + system administration
 >#Phases or stages of hacking 
 
1.Recconnaissance<br>
 2.scanning<br>
 3.gaining access<br>
 4.maintaning access<br>
 5.cleaning tracs and logs

 >#whats penetration testing?

 - is a method of evaluating the security of an informatin system
 
 {} There are three types of penetration testing these are Black box , White box , Grey box penetration testing .

 + Black box penetration testing:- Is a way of testing system with out prior knowledge.
 + White box penetration testing:- Is a way of testing  system with prior knowledge.
 + Grey box penetration testing:- Is a  way of testing system with  limited knowledge .
 
 
 >#How to use penetration testing method?

 + identification<br>
 + security protection  and control<br>
 + evaluate network security<br>
 + upgrade of information structure

 >Jobs with ethical hacking 
 + Bug hunting 
 + cyber security expert
 + Network security expert
 + security analysts ...
