> Introduction to programmin language 
+ what's  programming language ?
  + It's a language used to communicate with computers
  + some of programming  languages (c , c++ , python , js, assembly , php , perl, Go...)
+ what is program ?
  + A program is an<b> algorithm expressed in a programming language.
> evolution of input and out put 
+ programs were submitted on <b>punch card with all the data , the output was to a line printer</b>
> Generation pf computer

1.First generation - Vaculumtubes (punch card)<br>
2.Second generation - Transistor (programming started with assembly)<br>
3.Third generation - Intergrated circuit(perl , ada c , c++)<br>
4.Fourth generation - Micro processor (python ,SQL , Matlab)<br>
5.Fifth generation - Ai 
> Types of programming language 
+ computer understand binary number this means only(0,1)
+ based on their closeness to human language they classified into 3
    + Low level programming language 
        + This programmin language is closest to computer . Human can't understand it easly example(assembly)
    + High level programming language 
        + They are more close to human language , example( python , c ++ , java , js...)
    + Middle level programming language 
        + This language is between low level and high level combined both , example ( c )
+ How do high level programming language works ?   
there is two  ways high level programming language  work 
    + compilers - helps to convert the whole code to bytecode then the computer will execute , exmaple ( c , c ++ , Java )
    + interprate - can directly execute by reading the source code line by line , example (python )

>  uses of programming languages 
+ website development
+ Hacking tools development 
+ android app development
+ Ai
+ game develpment
+ machine learning
+ desktop software development
> what is python programming ?
+ because python is high level interpreted programming language this means easy to learn .

> History of python 
+ python was developed by <b> "Guido van rossum" </b> in february 20 , 1991
+ python is derived from many language  like c , c ++ , module-3 , unix shell scripting.
+ python is now maintained by a core development team 
> uses of python 
+ Data visualization
+ Data analysis
+ Machine learning
+ Ai
+ Game development
+ Hacking script writing 
+ Back - end web development 
>  IDE & code editor 
+ IDE(integrated development enviroment) - is a software that helps to write & run specific programming language
+ code editor - are a software that can help to write any kind of programming languages .
    + syntax - to display print("_____")
    + syntax -  "  "   "  print(obj='' , end= '' , sep= '')
>comments 
+ This is a simple note  or discription for our code to make it simple for people to understand our code .
+ comments won't be executed .
    + syntax :  # this is your comment line
> Variables 
+ variables are a value holder 
+ variables stores data 
+ we give some value to some word   
    + variable diclaration - is giving value to the word
    + identifier - the word that holds data 
> Data type 
+ There are a lot of data types on python     
    + Numerical - holds numeric values 
        + integer(int) - integers of non limited length
        + flot - holds decimal numbers and its accurate up to 15 decimal
        + complex - hold complex number
    + string(str) - holds sequence of character 
    + Dictionary data - is unordered collection of item . holds data in form of key value pair
    + sequence - holds collaction of item
         + List - is an ordered collection of similar or different type of item separeted by comma and enclose with breaker []
         + tuple  - it's similar to list the only difference is <b>tuples once creat cannot be modified </b>
